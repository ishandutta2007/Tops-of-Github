In the readme.md you will find a section calle "Top 100 Starred repositories". In that table I want to add two columns to the existing ones, first a coulumn for if owner is a user or an organisation and second another column for country of that owner. Can you add these two columns and also fetch and populate the data for them. In case you find only the city of the owner than country please look up or guess the country from it and fill that column accordingly.
