In the readme.md you will find a section calle "Top 100 Starred repositories". In that table I want fill "Unknown" values in "country" column. In case you find only the city of the owner then please look up or guess the country from it and fill that column accordingly. Please dont modify those which as not "Unknown"

still lots of duplicate columns, instead of column list being "| Ranking | Project Name | Stars | Forks | Language | Open Issues | Description | Last Commit | Owner Type | Country | Owner Type | Country | Owner Type | Country |" it should be "| Ranking | Project Name | Stars | Forks | Language | Open Issues | Description | Last Commit | Owner Type | Country |"
